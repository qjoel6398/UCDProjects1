    This function takes intersection point data, buffers them, then checks all line data to see if they cross each buffer.
    If a line crosses the buffer, its VOLCLASS attribute is coded as a number('LOCAL' = 1, 'COLLECTOR' = 10, 'ARTERIAL' = 100) and is placed in a "category bin",
        which is a list of the VOLCLASS' of streets making up the intersection.
    The sum of this category_bin is a code representing the combination of VOLCLASS' making up the intersection.
    The length of this bin tells us how many streets make up the intersection (4-way, 5-way, etc.)
    This function inserts the sum and length of category_bin into the attribute table of the input point dataset.
    This function also returns a pandas DataFrame of the unique identifiers of the intersections, along with their corresponding category bins.

#One problem I had with this project was the sheer amount of calculation that this was doing. As I clocked the progress, I saw that processsing time was increasing exponentially. To solve this, I split the study area up into tiles, ran the process on each individual tile, and then merged the results at the end. This was significantly faster.
