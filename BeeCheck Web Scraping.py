##DELAY:
##
##you can introduce an intentional delay or lag in your scraper to slow it down
#
#for term in ["web scraping", "web crawling", "scrape this site"]:
#    r = requests.get("http://example.com/search", params=dict(
#        query=term
#    ))
#    time.sleep(5)  # wait 5 seconds before we make the next request
#   



##BACKOFF
##Some also recommend adding a backoff thatâ€™s proportional to how long the site took to respond to your request. 
##That way if the site gets overwhelmed and starts to slow down, your code will automatically back off.
#
#for term in ["web scraping", "web crawling", "scrape this site"]:
#    t0 = time.time()
#    r = requests.get("http://example.com/search", params=dict(
#        query=term
#    ))
#    response_delay = time.time() - t0
#    time.sleep(10*response_delay)  # wait 10x longer than it took them to respond
